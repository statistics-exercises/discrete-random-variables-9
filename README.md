# Generating negative binomial random variables

We have one final type of random variable to learn how to generate using python - the negative binomial random variable.  If you remember 
the negative binomial random variables measures the number of trials I have to perform in order to obtain exactly k successes. A negative binomial random variables can be generated by generating k geometric random variables and adding them together.

To complete the exercise you will need to:

- Write a function called `bernoulli` that takes in a parameter called `p`. This parameter gives the probability that the trial is successful - and that the 
function thus returns a 1

- Use your `bernoulli` function in a second function called `geometric`. This `geometric` function should take one parameter `p` (the probability of success in each individual trial). The function should then return a geometric random variable.

- Write one final function called `negative_binomial`.  This `negative_binomial` function should take two parameters: `p` (the probability of success in each individual trial) and `k` (the number of successes that you would like to observe).  The function should then return a negative binomial random variable.
